NFDMLAB: Simulating Nonlinear Frequency Division Multiplexing in Python
=======================================================================

NFDMLab is an open source software environment that simulates
fiber-optic data transmissions using nonlinear Fourier transforms. The goals
and architecture of NFDMLab are described in the accompanying software
paper:

   M. Brehler, C. Mahnke, S. Chimmalgi and S. Wahls, `"NFDMLab:
   Simulating Nonlinear Frequency Division Multiplexing in Python,"
   <https://doi.org/10.1364/OFC.2019.M3Z.13>`_ Optical Networking and
   Communication Conference & Exhibition (OFC), paper M3Z.13, Mar. 2019.
